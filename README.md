# Pac-Man Modified
Computer Architecture class project. A modified version of the classic game Pac-Man written in PEPE-16 Assembly.

## Prerequisites

To run the program, you need to have an appropriate Java version installed. This project requires Java with JavaFX support. If you have more than one Java version installed, ensure you set the path to the appropriate one.

## Running the Simulator

### If Java Path is Set Globally

If your Java path is set globally to the one with JavaFX, you can use the UI and just double-click on the [simulator.jar](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).

### If Java Path is Not Set Globally

Navigate to the directory that contains the [simulator.jar](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) and run the following command:

- **Windows**:
  ```sh
  "C:\path\to\java\bin\java.exe" -jar simulator.jar
- **Unix(MacOS / Linux)**:
    ```sh
    /path/to/java/bin/java -jar simulator.jar
